# Developer Workflow Config
### This is my current dev config, as of now I've configured:
- Neovim (with lazy.nvim as plugin manager)
- Tmux
- Ghostty
- Yazi
### I've also implemented some bash scripts, these are the main ones
- tmux-sessionizer / ready-tmux (Handles tmux sessions with a fzf search) Thanks [@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)
- dev-env (copies all config to your $HOME)
